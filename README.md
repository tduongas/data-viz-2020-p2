Project Specification

Brief articulation - 

Used public accessible datasets to visually assess the impact of Covid-19 on local schools and hospitals in the state of Florida.


Is it safe for schools to open in a particular county?
- Number of of infected versus hospitalization / ICU bed availability
- What criteria would we choose? 
	+ If more than 20 under the age of 20 die then we cannot open


Look at the number of cases versus population to see if this will give insight on schools to re-open

We will perform Extract Transform and Load (ETL) technique to take the following datasets:
